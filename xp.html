    <h1>Extreme Programming training</h1>
    <p>I provided a training about extreme programming at ilegra. I presented extreme programming foundation during the morning
    followed by a coding dojo. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/toff63/Presentations/tree/6ebaf6cfb7dd06d11793f8283565175ba4070de9/xp/code/dojo_result">my github</a>. I presented the few remaining concepts during the afternoon before involving people
    into a xp game.

    <h2>XP Game</h2>
    I provided a very dirty and simple code having the following features: add/remove/list tasks. It has 3 phases: planning (20 minutes), 
    sprint (1h20) and demo/retrospective (20 minutes). We managed to perform 2 sprints during the afternoon.
