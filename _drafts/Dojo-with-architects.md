title: Dojo for Software Architect
---

Last month I organized a dojo for the architects of my company. To become software architect in my company, you need to become a very highly skilled software developer first. Consequently, even thought, we still write code as software architect, I don't think this is the most critical skill to practice anymore. 

I decided to practice with them some kind of discovery process. 

# Before the dojo

Two weeks before the dojo I start spending some time exploring ideas related to  *Data driven* system. I started with Data driven because a lot of company are selling data and we are very used to consume and by data in various forms. It can be as a newspaper, watching Netflix or watching tv. The business is not very hard to guess. From there, I sent an invite to the architects with a subject to study:

The idea is that everybody study everything, but ultimately focusing on the subject that has been assigned to him. I have chosen the subjects because they appear in the mind map I started when studying Data driven system

# During the dojo

I asked for everyone to start drawing some mind map showing the kind of requirements we should expect in such a system, the problem that will probably raise, the kind of architecture that could cope with such kind of problems and everything related. We started drawing our mindmap during 25 minutes.
Then, one by one, we exposed our mind map to the other and started discussions. The main value of the exercise are the discussions that starts that are usually of very high quality. We ended discussing on
* form of data input
* possible review process
* nature of the data and its inherent structure
* difference between data consumption needs and data creation needs in term of database/search engine
* crossing data when the company recently bought a new data source and need to complete its existing data
* Artificial Intelligence
* What define a data driven system and if Internet of Things could be considered as a Data driven system
* Usage of data: intelligence, support or media content

At the end we started to build a mind map without linking the subjects as this can still be considered as draft.

# Conclusion

It was fun and generated a lot of interesting dicussions. We are now better prepared to work with data driven system and got some practice on extracting concepts based on the nature of a problem.
