<h2 id="install">Install play framewok</h2>
<p>You can have a look at the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/Installing">official page</a> for installing play. However you will need to have java 6 or later installed on you conputer. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the last play version <a href="http://www.playframework.org/download">here</a></li>
	<li>Unzip it in a directory where you have the right to read and write (somhewer in your home directory should be fine)</li>
	<li>Add the bin directory from play to your PATH environment variable</li>
	<li>You should now be able to open a command console or terminal and tyep <code>play</code> or <code>play.bat</code>< on windows</li>
	<li>Go to the directory where you want to create your project and write the command <code>play new play2Tutorial</code></li>
	<li>The last command will ask you the name of the application and the programming language you want to use. I chose Scala as programming language.</li>
	<li>Go into the project directory and write play eclipse to generate an eclipse project</li>
</ol>
In order to develop your application in eclipse I strongly suggest to download the last <a href="http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html">scala ide release</a>. Once installed, go in Help -> Install New Software. Select the Scala ide site. A list of plugins should appear. Select Play2 to install. Once you are done, import play2 project as an Existing Project into the workspace.
